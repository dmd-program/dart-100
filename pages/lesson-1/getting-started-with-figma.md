# Getting started with Figma


For many of the assignments in this class, we will be using the popular design app Figma. 

## What is Figma?

Figma is a web app, which means you can use it in your web browser, though you can also install a desktop app to run it separately. 

While mainly used to design user interfaces for apps and websites, Figma is a great 2D design tool that will help us explore the fundamental concepts of picture-making and visual syntax. Figma relies on vector shapes, and has a lot in common with Adobe Illustrator ‚Äî so if you‚Äôve used that, you should feel right at home. 

**Vectors** are shapes defined by points, that can be scaled up or down infinitely without losing image quality; they are distinct from raster images like JPEGs, which are made of a grid of pixels. Purely vector graphics have no pixels, although you can add a JPEG photograph into a Figma or other vector file. 

Within Figma, you can create a Design File or a FigJam file. We will primarily be working with Design Files, but [FigJam](https://www.figma.com/figjam/) is worth knowing about too. It‚Äôs a simpler version of Figma, geared for quick brainstorming and diagramming, with virtual post-it notes and easy whiteboard drawing tools. 

Figma files can be easily shared online ‚Äî with a private or public share link, just like Google Docs. You can also collaborate on a Figma file ****************at the same time**************** as other users, synchronously working on a design together.

## Creating a Student Account

To get the most out of Figma, you should signup with your university email address and [get verified as a student](https://www.figma.com/education/). This gives your account some special features, and ensures your instructor can add you to shared file. 

üö®¬†*You must use your Penn State email address when creating your account. If you have a personal Figma account, you should create a new one.*

## Desktop or Web App?

You can use Figma in your web browser or as a standalone desktop app. They have the same functionality.

**Web app**

- Easy access to other tabs in your browser.
- Automatically includes all fonts from Google Fonts.
- Install the [Figma Font Service utility](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039956894-Access-local-fonts-on-your-computer) to access all fonts on your computer.

**Desktop app**

- Looks cleaner because it‚Äôs not in your browser.
- Automatically loads all fonts on your computer (plus Google Fonts).

## Accessing the Shared Class File

Your instructor will invite you to join a Shared Class File, which we will use for upcoming assignments. Look for an email once you have created your student Figma account. 

Once you‚Äôve accessed the file, it will appear on your Figma homepage under ‚ÄúRecents.‚Äù 

(Files you personally create will be shown under ‚ÄúDrafts.‚Äù)

We won‚Äôt actually be doing anything in the Shared Class File yet! But you should ensure you can successfully access it for next week and get your Figma account created.
